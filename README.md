# HOSPITALITY-REVENUE-ANALYSIS

The primary objective of the Hospitality Revenue Analysis project is to develop a comprehensive Power BI dashboard that consolidates and visualizes revenue-related data from various sources within the hospitality business. The dashboard will enable stakeholders to track revenue performance, monitor KPIs, identify revenue drivers, and make data-driven decisions to optimize revenue streams and enhance business operations.
